    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled party wings are always a crowd favorite. Grilling them creates a nice charred taste, and if done correctly, can leave them with a scrumptious crunchy skin. The skin won't be as crunchy as fried wings, but they will still satisfy everyone who enjoys a bit of crunch to their wings.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pounds Party Wings</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Freshly ground salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Favorite Buffalo or BBQ sauce of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat grill to 350-400 degrees F</li>
        <li>While grill is heating, place wings in a large bowl. Cover wings in about 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Toss the wings to evenly coat each wing. Using a fresh pepper grinder, generously pepper the wings. Add salt to taste. Freshly ground salt works best.</li>
        <li>Add wings to grill. Keep wings close together. Space in between will decrease their juicineess.</li>
        <li>Grill wings for 25-30 minutes, turning the wings every 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Toward the end of the time frame thinner wings will be done a bit before the thicker ones. Use a meat thermometer to ensure each wing is 165 degree F. Place smaller wings that are done earlier in a bowl, while keeping a close eye on the larger ones.</li>
        <li>Once all the wings are finished cooking, place them in a large bowl. Toss the wings in your sauce of choice. I always prefer a generous amount of sauce, but add sauce to your own personal preference</li>
        <li>Time to eat the wings! Grilling wings can take some learning as cooking time can vary per grill. Be patient and practice makes perfect!</li>
    </ol>
