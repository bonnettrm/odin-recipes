    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb shrimp. Raw or frozen</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Honey</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger (if using) together in a medium bowl. You will use half for the marinade in step 2 and half for cooking the shrimp in step 3.</li>
        <li>Place shrimp in a large sealable container or zipped-top bag. Pour 1/2 of the marinade/sauce mixture on top, give it all a shake or stir, then allow shrimp to marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes or for up to 8-12 hours. Cover and refrigerate the rest of the marinade for step 3. (Time-saving tip: while the shrimp is marinating, we usually steam broccoli and microwave some quick brown rice.)</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place shrimp in the skillet. (Discard used marinade.) Cook shrimp on one side until pink, about 45 seconds, then flip shrimp over. Pour in remaining marinade/sauce and cook it all until shrimp is cooked through, about 1-2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve shrimp with cooked marinade sauce and a garnish of green onion. The sauce is excellent on brown rice and steamed vegetables on the side.</li>
    </ol>
